# History
Open Geneva was established in 2015 by the <a href="http://www.creativitycenter.ch/" target = "_blank">Geneva Creativity Center</a> in order to promote innovation for the improvement of life quality in Geneva. During the 1st edition, several teams of students worked during 2 weekends on scientific projects, as well as social and technical innovations, related to energy, health, mobility. The 2016 edition was focused on medical technologies and brought a larger scope of participants during a curated hackathon organized by <a href="http://theport.ch/" target = "_blank">The Port</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.hug-ge.ch/en/" target="_blank"> Geneva University Hospitals</a>.

# Edition 2017
In 2017, Open Geneva became a festival of hackathons. With the support of the <a href="http://unige.ch/numerique/en/" target="_blank">Digital Strategy of the University of Geneva</a>, more than 21 initiatives were organized, with the involvement of schools and research centers, administrations and companies, public and private institutions. Approximately 400 participants with a broad variety of skills and motivations developed over 50 innovatives projects, among which some have continued to develop. This keen interest is a confirmation that there is a real commitment for open innovation in Geneva.
