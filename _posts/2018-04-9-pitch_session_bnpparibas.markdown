You have worked out a project on the following themes during Open Geneva :

* ***Services 4.0*** (rethink a durable service economy with respect to innovation and digital)
* ***Businesses in the city: which social and sustainabilty impact ?***
* ***What actions can be undertaken for the transition?***


<br>
You are welcome to come and pitch your SDG project on the BNP Paribas & Amaris booth on Sunday 15th April from 2:30pm until 3:30pm during the [HACKSHOW]({{ site.baseurl }}/hackshow). Experts and coaches in innovation from BNP Paribas & Amaris will be here to listen to your ideas.


*To be the bank of a changing world is to always partner better with our clients and our teams
while contributing to a sustainable growth better shared. For us in Geneva, this means to embed
in our local ecosystem a contribution to the local urban, social and cultural environments. To
actively participate to Open Geneva is to embody this engaged enterprise strategy*Â Isabelle
