Since early 2017 [Tsinghua x-lab](http://www.x-lab.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} and the [University of Geneva](http://unige.ch){:target="_blank"} have engaged in discussions regarding establishing a collaboration avenue to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in both universities. In building on two vibrant innovation ecosystems, and as a first step to widening the scope of collaboration Tsinghua x-lab and the University of Geneva will support and nurture each other’s startup teams, coming to explore potential markets, build a local network and engage additional resources.

**For the first time, the two institutions will actively target entrepreneurial teams generated out of joint educational programs and the Open Geneva Hackathon, with the intent of not only bringing forth great ideas, but supporting further development of the idea to a workable solution and then to product.**

x-lab and the University of Geneva will use their respective spaces to house 2-3 teams visiting for a period of 2 weeks at a time. During their stay, the visiting teams will receive ground support from both organizations in accessing local resources, meeting with investors, mentors and corporates of interest, and engaging with each other’s industry and sector consultants.

This is a one of a kind opportunity for early stage startups to map out, explore and venture into markets, shaping their product development and giving them a taste of future markets and partners.
