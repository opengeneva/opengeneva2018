***About ARK.io***

**ARK.io** ecosystem aims to interconnect blockchains through what is called the **ARK.io** Smartbridge. **ARK.io** uses delegated-proof-of-stake as its protocol in which 51 nominated delegates are tasked with running the network. Delegates distribute dividends to those who voted for them in exchange for their support. **ARK** looks to connect blockchains by tweaking the code to become compatible with their own network. Once connected the protocol makes it possible to communicate and trigger functions on a completely different blockchain.

*About SonoCoin*

**SonoCoin** is a digitally encrypted audio file that operates on a proprietary blockchain system, using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to verify transactions. The **SonoCoin** audio file is a sound interpretation of a code that can be recognized and recorded by any device that reproduces sound. The **SonoCoin** solution is similar to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer value transfer, with an improved and more user-friendly platform similar to PayPal. To reduce the cost for end-users, the service has been streamlined to a less complex lighter protocol. Operations and interfaces use a light version of the blockchain network, allowing for a decentralized operation with faster transactions. The framework also provides transaction flexibility across various popular peer-to-peer messaging platforms, social networks, and email.
