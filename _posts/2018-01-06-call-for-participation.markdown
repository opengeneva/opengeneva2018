Registration for event proposals is now open. During the warm-up period,
ideas and projects in the making are very welcome. If you wish, we will announce your project
and thus help you to gather a community to help you bootstrap your event.

We encourage to feature and share your event project ideas early, in a way that other
organizations, institutions and citizen can further help you gain traction.
