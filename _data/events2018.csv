TRUE,English & French (remix),UN Environment /GRID-Geneva. University of Geneva / NASA enviroSPACE,Swiss Data Cube Hackathon,"Currently, one of the main issue that Switzerland is facing is to better understand  how the snow cover evolves through years  (especially taking into account climate changes). The Swiss Data Cube (SDC) allows identifying areas that are covered by snow and those who are not. Using the the SDC we can map the evolution of the snow cover over the country and through time to track its evolution. 
Another problem that we are currently facing is to develop a demo products on Sustainable Development Goals using Earth Observations data to help Swiss government to track progresses towards the SDGs. An ideas would be to identify (among the SDGs that can be measures using Earth Observations) one SDG indicators and to develop a workflow to compute this indicator at the national scale.",The Swiss Data Cube (SDC) has gathered all freely available satellite images of Switzerland from the Landsat and Sentinel programmes. This constitutes a unique 33 years archive of Earth Observations over Switzerland. The aim of this hackathon is to explore and develop a prototype application for monitoring Switzerland's environment in space and time using Earth Observations.,hackathon,logo_swiss_data_cube.png,flyer_swiss_data_cube.png,http://www.swissdatacube.org/index.php/2018/03/07/opengeneva-hackathon-sdc-sdg/,https://goo.gl/forms/Vopz3VF3vPjwc97v1,"Centre Universitaire Informatique, Université de Genève, Battelle - bâtiment A, 7, route de Drize, CH-1227 Carouge",11-04-2018,13-04-2018,@SwissDataCube,,
